            <h3>The growth of electric mobility</h3>
            <p> will have far-reaching consequences for auto dealers, touching virtually every aspect of business. From the redistribution of profit pools to the adoption of new operating procedures, there’s a lot to consider. Maintenance workers will need training to service high-voltage powertrain systems safely and efficiently, while frontline sales staff will be expected to competently answer consumer questions and close the sale. Electric vehicles (EVs) also tend to have fewer mechanical parts that break down, which has significant implications for aftersales service. To help US dealerships prepare for the coming change, we assess the state of EV sales readiness along six key dimensions while offering an in-depth analysis of the US EV market.

                That the global EV market—including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs)—has continued to heat up in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic is no less than remarkable. Despite an overall slump in car sales worldwide, 2020 was a banner year for electric-vehicle sales, with global sales actually exceeding prepandemic levels by the third quarter of the year. Incredibly,

            <h3>Train the frontline and transform the sales journey</h3>
            <p>
                Dealers can continue to digitize the sales journey and offer a seamless, omnichannel experience that touches on not only the EV itself but also the broader ownership experience, such as charging and service. They can enhance the customer experience by including EV-specific elements within the showroom (for example, the fast-charging experience) and provide an end-to-end offering for customers that makes EV ownership as simple as possible (for instance, selling preferred installation services for at-home charging equipment).
            </p>
            <p>
                Dealers can also continue to train sales associates or designate EV experts to become knowledgeable about important buying criteria such as range, vehicle performance, service expectations, and day-to-day operation. They might fine-tune each step of the decision journey to cover all aspects of EV ownership (for example, adapt the test drive to include charging the vehicle, in addition to vehicle performance). As the EV market continues to expand, a properly trained frontline sales staff can skillfully guide consumers to the right vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                To capture growing customer demand, dealers could adjust vehicle inventory to include a greater number of new and used electric vehicles. To further optimize inventory, they might employ data and analytics to achieve the most competitive inventory at the trim level. For example, by tracking broader marketing inventory and trends, dealers can optimize their inventory to focus on high-demand and high-margin vehicles and trim levels. In addition, by offering comprehensive subscription models as an affordable entry into EVs—for instance, an extended test-drive phase or a short-term ownership solution such as a month-by-month lease—dealerships could reduce cost barriers to EV ownership.
